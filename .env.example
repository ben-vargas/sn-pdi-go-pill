# ServiceNow Instance Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your configuration

# JSON Configuration - Set this environment variable with your instances
# You can either:
# 1. Store the JSON directly in the environment variable (be careful with escaping)
# 2. Read from a file: export SERVICENOW_INSTANCES_JSON=$(cat instances.json)

SERVICENOW_INSTANCES_JSON='{"instances":[{"name":"prod","url":"https://prod.service-now.com","username":"user","password":"pass"},{"name":"dev","url":"https://dev.service-now.com","username":"user","password":"pass"}]}'

# For better readability during local development, create an instances.json file
# and load it with: export SERVICENOW_INSTANCES_JSON=$(cat instances.json)
